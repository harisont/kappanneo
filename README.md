# about me
#### in short

i was born in italy, assingned male at birth, and used to believe gender identity would be limited to human biology, not sociology:

my chromosomes are XY and i didn't experience lack of testosterone nor gender disphoria, therefore i identified as a "male" (again, thinking about my biology, only) for most of my life (~25yo). 

that said, now i see myself as an [agender person](https://en.pronouns.page/@kappanneo) ([e/ym](https://github.com/even-is-odd/pronomey)) who was able to see outside the italian cultural bubble and eventually managed to escape to sweden with the love of my life, Arianna, who is currenlty my "sambo" (swedish for cohinabitant partner)

i've always loved biology and mathematics, therfore i:

0. studied computer science (and **not** mathematics, as you can see in the indexing of this list)
1. managed to arrange an Erasmus excahnge in Sweden, where i spent my last semester of my italian bachelor 
2. did my bachelor thesis on private blockchains and token-based access control (before its widespread adoption)
3. hated what i saw in both the research, and the real, world
4. got stuck on a high performance computing master for a while
5. accepted my nature as a logician (finally)
6. switching master back to theoretical computer science
7. took one year off, beacause i needed to take a break, after twenty years of studying nonstop
