stuff about me

## mandatory gender stuff
i was born in italy, assingned male at birth and for a long time (~25 years) i believed gender *as a concept* to be limited to biology (like chromosomes and stuff). got very disappointed when i saw how much of a social role it played (... and still plays) in almost all human societies around the world

i am still officially a *man* (e.g. on all my documents), also by genotype (my chromosomes are XY\*) and by phenotype (i didn't experience lack of testosterone as far as i can tell), plus i *luckely* do not suffer from gender dysphoria, and i could easily identify as a *male* person ***if only we lived in a society capable of not making all kids of assumptions based on gender identity***

\*doubt we'll find a way to change that

**tldr:** i identify as an [agender person](https://en.pronouns.page/@kappanneo) ([e/ir](https://github.com/even-is-odd/pronomey))


## greatest luck so far
being able to:
- see outside the italian cultural bubble 
- somehow manage to expatriate to sweden with the love of my life, Arianna, who is my one and only sambo[^3] (but not my only partner)

## my studies

### past-to-current
i've always loved chemistry and biology since i was a child, therfore i:

0. studied *computer science*
1. managed to arrange an *Erasmus+ exchange in Sweden*, during the last semester of my italian bachelor 
2. wrote my bachelor thesis about *private blockchains* and *token-based access control systems*[^2]
3. hated what i saw in both the research, and the real, world
4. got stuck on a *high performance computing* master programme for a while (in sweden)
5. accepted my nature as a *logician* (finally)
6. switched master back to *just* computer science
7. took one year off, beacause i needed to take a break, after twenty years of studying nonstop

[^2]: allow me to say it: *"i like tokens since before they where cool"* (i don't really care tbh, security is not my field)

### coming next

8. going back to school (september 2022)
