# about me
#### in short

i was born in italy, assingned male at birth and for a long time i believed gender -as a concept- to be limited to human biology (like chromosomes and stuff). got very disappointed when i saw how much of a social role it played (... and still plays) in all societies around the world.

my chromosomes are XY and i didn't experience lack of testosterone nor gender disphoria, therefore i identified as a "male" (again, thinking about my biology, only) for most of my life (~25yo). now i see myself as an [agender person](https://en.pronouns.page/@kappanneo) ([e/ir](https://github.com/even-is-odd/pronomey)).

my greatest luck so far: being able to see outside the italian cultural bubble and -somehow- to escape to sweden with the love of my life, Arianna, who is currenlty my "sambo" (swedish for cohinabitant partner).

i've always loved chemistry and biology since i was a child, therfore i:

0. studied *computer science* (**not mathematics**, as you can *clearly* tell by looking at the indexing of this list)
1. managed to arrange an *Erasmus+ exchange in Sweden*, during the last semester of my italian bachelor 
2. did my bachelor thesis on *private blockchains* and *token-based access control* (the latter being litterellay everywhere now LOL)
3. hated what i saw in both the research, and the real, world
4. got stuck on a *high performance computing* master programme for a while (in sweden)
5. accepted my nature as a *logician* (finally)
6. switched master back to *just* computer science
7. took one year off, beacause i needed to take a break, after twenty years of studying nonstop

coming next:

8. going back to school (september 2022)
